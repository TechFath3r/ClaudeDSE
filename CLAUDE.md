I need a new website making for my small (I am the only employee) Phone / laptop / computer electronics repair business. Our current website is at [dannstarr.co.uk](www.dannstarr.co.uk) but is over 13 years old and severely needs an overhaul. DSLogo.png is my business logo, which should also be used as a favicon.

I want to also emphasise that we offer bespoke web design and management services.

The site should be fast, modern, and optimised for the latest SEO best practices. It should make smart use of css animations where appropriate. I'd like a light and a dark mode which visitors can toggle from the nav bar. It's design should be in line with a modern computer tech company, but also give a friendly approachable family friendly feel - our local customers are our friends. I'd like a news / blog area where I can make regular updates or articles. Our front page should prominently display our opening times (Mon-Fri 1000-1800, Saturday 1000-1500, Sundays closed, our contact number (07907830976) and our address (61 Rotten Row, Pinchbeck, PE11 3RQ) and email address (dannstarrelectronics@gmail.com) we should feature a "book a repair" button which points here: https://app.repairkeeper.co.uk/enquire/dannstarr-electronics 

I'd like to explore smart ways in which I can lay out my pricing for our most common repairs, and be able to easily update them, perhaps via an external file? i'd like to know what options I have in that regard. 

I would like to host it for free via github pages, but it should be built for future plugins such as an AI chatbot (we will build as it's own standalone project that we can integrate into any website) maybe a store, and later possibly even our own custom calendar booking app that we build and host ourselves (which will have the ability to be used by other developers in their projects too)

Ask me any questions you feel would help you get the best tailored website for me, and for any additional information that you'd like me to provide.
