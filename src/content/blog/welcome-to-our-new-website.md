We're thrilled to announce the launch of our brand new website! After over 13 years with our trusty old site, we felt it was time for a complete overhaul to better serve our customers and showcase everything we do here at DannStarr Electronics.

## What's New?

Our new site has been built from the ground up with a focus on speed, modern design, and making it as easy as possible for you to find what you need.

### Clear Pricing

One of the biggest changes is our comprehensive **pricing page**. We've always believed in transparent pricing, and now you can see exactly what our most common repairs cost before you even pick up the phone. From iPhone screens to laptop keyboards, it's all there.

### Easy Online Booking

You can now **book a repair online** anytime, day or night. Just click the "Book a Repair" button and fill in a few details. We'll get back to you as quickly as we can to confirm your appointment.

### This Blog!

We'll be using this blog to share tech tips, repair guides, and news from the workshop. If there's something you'd like us to write about, just let us know.

## Web Design Services

You might not know this, but we also build websites! This very site is an example of what we can do. If your business needs a modern, fast, mobile-friendly website, we'd love to chat. Our bespoke web design services start from just **£250**.

## Same Great Service

While the website is new, the service you know and trust hasn't changed. We're still the same friendly, local repair shop at **61 Rotten Row, Pinchbeck**. Pop in anytime during opening hours, give us a ring on **07907 830976**, or book online.

Thank you for your continued support. We couldn't do what we do without our amazing customers!
